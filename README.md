## Summary of Project
#### Description 📝: 
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales using PostgreSQL and visualized the results using Excel. I had 14 questions to answer, and I created a presentation with the results, saved as a PDF. First, I created a temporary table containing columns from the four datasets I needed for analysis. Then, I explored these columns for null values before starting to answer all 14 questions. I decided to create this project and practice my SQL skills after completing the DataCamp course called "Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL" here is the certificate:
